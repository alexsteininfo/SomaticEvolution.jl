Simulation => branching process

Input parameters:
	Detection limit = 0.050
	Ploidy = 2
	Read depth = 100
	œÅ = 0.00
	Cellularity = 1.00

	Max population size = 10000
	Mutation rate (per division) = 100
	Clonal mutations = 200
	Birth rate (wild type)= 0.69
	Death rate (wild type)= 0.00
	Max size before mutations stop accumulating (will not be detected) = 200.00

	Number of subclones = 1
Subclone output:
Subclone 1: 
Input:	Selection strength, s: 1.00

	Time subclone emerges (population doublings): 6.03
	Number of divisions: 9
	Average number of divisions per cell: 7.46
	Population size when subclone emerges: 79
	Parent of subclone (0 is host): 0
